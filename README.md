About the project

Hangman is a simple word game that anyone can play. The first player needs to guess the word that the second player has thought (on our case the second player is the computer). Tries to find the word by choosing to write different letters each time. If the choosen letter does not exist on the word then the player loses one life . The game finishes when the player has found the word or if the player has been hanged ( lost all of his lifes).
